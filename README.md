Clinical Research Data Management

This repository was created to host practical tools and reproducible workflows for data management, analysis, and decision support in clinical research.

The initial focus is on algorithms that support patient screening and protocol matching, using structured clinical and operational data as preliminary filters to optimize manual eligibility assessment. The repository is designed to be data-agnostic, excluding sensitive or identifiable information, and emphasizing transparent, reusable logic applicable across different clinical research settings.

Over time, this space may expand to include additional resources for clinical trial feasibility, recruitment analytics, protocol oversight, and real-world data exploration, always with a focus on pragmatic solutions for real operational problems in clinical research.
